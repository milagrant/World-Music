### Project in DD2430 at KTH

#### Structuring the data
1. Make sure you have the full smithsonian dataset. 
It is ignored by git due to size.
2. Create a directory named *data*. 
This will contain the resulting data and will also be ignored by git.
3. Run 
``
python subset.py
``
This might take a few minutes since 10k files are processed.
